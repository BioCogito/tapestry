<h2>Personal Health Record</h2>

<p>We believe that PGP participants will benefit over the long-term if select personal health information is managed through a standardized Personal Health Record (PHR).  The Personal Genome Project has selected Google Health as our preferred PHR provider.  In order to be considered for enrollment, the PGP requests that you follow the instructions and guidelines for creating, populating, and sharing a Google Health PHR.  <a href="/PGP_PHR_Instructions_10262009.pdf">Download Instructions (PDF)</a>.</p>
