Use this README file to introduce your application and point to useful places in the API for learning more.
Run "rake doc:app" to generate API documentation for your models, controllers, helpers, and libraries.

== Enrollment Steps ==
Enrollment Steps guide the "main menu" that the user sees.  These should always be loaded from
db/bootstrap with the following rake task:


rake db:bootstrap:load FIXTURES=enrollment_steps

== Deploying ==
As part of getting access to the deploy cluter, you'll need the following
in your  ~/.ssh/config:

Host *.oxf
   ProxyCommand ssh -p2222 turnout@switchyard.oxf.freelogy.org -x -a -o "Compression no" $SSH_PROXY_FLAGS %h
   User YOUR_SSH_USER_NAME_HERE
