            <strong>We are seeking a diverse range of volunteers from as varied a set of genetic, social and environmental backgrounds as possible.  Volunteers must be willing to make their genetic and other human trait information publicly available and be knowledgeable about genetics, human subjects research and the benefits and risks of participation in a public genomics research project of this nature.</strong> </p></td>

<p><strong><u>I. PURPOSE</u></strong><br />
This eligibility screening form for the Personal Genome Project (this “Eligibility Screening”) is intended to help determine whether you are a candidate for enrollment in a public and open-ended research study such as the Personal Genome Project (also the “PGP” or the “study”).&nbsp; If you successfully complete this Eligibility Screening you may be invited to enroll in the PGP.</p>
<p>The Personal Genome Project is a new form of public genomics research.  The main scientific goal of this study is to find ways to connect human genetic information (i.e., human DNA sequence, associated microbial sequence data and other molecular traits) with human trait information (i.e., medical information, tissue samples and physical traits) in a public way so that such data may be used for research and other scientific, patient care and commercial purposes worldwide.  Additional goals include (i) exploring the opportunities, impacts and risks of public genomics research such as the PGP; (ii) developing a public dataset of information from willing participants to aid in the development of analytical tools for scientists, clinicians and individuals; and (iii) educating participants and the general public about the potential benefits, risks, and uncertainties posed by the widespread availability of genetic and related information.  The PGP also seeks to develop a model system for experts on health care, molecular biology, genetic counseling, public health, law, education, and research to come together and collaborate.  We hope that the PGP’s proposed datasets will help to extend such discussions to the creation of case studies and to find out what individuals, clinicians, and researchers might want or not want in such datasets, and why.</p>
<p>If you successfully complete this Eligibility Screening and are subsequently enrolled in the PGP, your genetic and trait information will be made available on a publicly accessible website and database, as described in the separate PGP consent form.&nbsp; You will be asked to review the PGP consent form as part of your participation in this Eligibility Screening.&nbsp; In order to complete this Eligibility Screening and to be considered for enrollment in the PGP, you are first required to complete certain eligibility screening procedures online, including the eligibility questionnaire and entrance exam, and to review the separate PGP consent form.&nbsp; This Eligibility Screening is intended to help determine whether you are a candidate for enrollment in the PGP.</p>

<p><strong><u>II. WHAT IS INFORMED CONSENT</u></strong> <br />
Informed consent means you understand the procedures, risks, possible benefits, and alternatives before you voluntarily agree to participate in a research study.&nbsp; Before you elect to participate, you need to understand if or how this Eligibility Screening may affect you and your family.&nbsp; This Eligibility Screening consent form, along with other documents available on the PGP’s website (http://www.personalgenomes.org/), is intended to help you make an informed decision about your participation in this Eligibility Screening.&nbsp; Should you successfully complete this Eligibility Screening you will need to complete a separate informed consent form before you may be invited to enroll in the PGP.&nbsp; The PGP website will be revised as needed, possibly on a frequent basis, and you should check the website regularly to obtain the most current information about this Eligibility Screening and the PGP.</p>
 
<p><strong><u>III. DURATION </u></strong><br />

1.1 The eligibility questionnaire will take approximately 5-15 minutes.<br />

1.2 The entrance exam will take approximately 30-90 minutes, but may take longer depending on your familiarity with genetics and other concepts relevant to participation in the PGP.<br />

1.3 Reading and reviewing the PGP consent form will take approximately 30 minutes, but may take longer depending on your familiarity with genetics and other concepts relevant to participation in the PGP.
</p>
