As part of our process for releasing genomes publicly, we provide each
participant with their genomic data and a preliminary genome analysis
prior to publication, as described in Section 5.4 and Section 5.5 of
the Consent for Participation: http://www.personalgenomes.org/consent/

Your raw genomic data and preliminary genome analysis are now
available for you to review. It is important that you remember that
both the data and the analysis are intended for research use only. The
generation of genomic data is not an error-free process and our genome
analysis system is still under development. Because the body of
knowledge of genetic variants has many uncertainties, we cannot
guarantee that your analysis is either accurate or complete.

Your genomic data and preliminary analysis almost certainly contain
meaningful errors and mistakes, such as:

* Variants which are actually benign (not harmful) are reported as
  pathogenic (harmful).

* Variants which are actually pathogenic (harmful) are reported as
  benign (not harmful).

* Variants which are pathogenic (harmful) are not reported at all.

Mix-ups are also possible and this means that the genomic data we
return to you might be derived from or contaminated by another
personâ€™s specimens. For a more detailed summary of potential risks
related to participation in the PGP, you may wish to review Section 6
of the Consent for Participation:

YOU SHOULD NOT USE EITHER YOUR GENOMIC DATA OR YOUR GENOME ANALYSIS
REPORT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE, DIAGNOSIS OR
TREATMENT. IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ANY ASPECT OF YOUR DATA OR
REPORT YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH A LICENSED HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL.

In the event that your genome data and preliminary analysis contain
variants predicted to have effects on your health that you find
concerning, the National Center for Biotechnology Information supports
a voluntary listing of US and international genetics clinics providing
genetic evaluation and genetic counseling:
