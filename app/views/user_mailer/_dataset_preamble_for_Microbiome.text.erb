As part of our process for releasing data publicly, we provide each
participant with their data and a preliminary analysis prior to
publication, as described in Section 5.4 and Section 5.5 of the
Consent for Participation: http://www.personalgenomes.org/consent/

Your raw data and preliminary analysis results are now available for
you to review. The analysis results can be viewed by performing the
following steps: (1) download the ZIP-compressed file (2) "unzip" this
file to get a directory containing various files (3) use a web browser
to "open a local file" (4) navigate to the directory containing your
data and open the file "index.html".

It is important that you remember that both the data and the analysis
are intended for research use only. The generation of the data is not
an error-free process and the analysis is an area of active
research. Because the significance of the data has many uncertainties,
we cannot guarantee that your analysis is either accurate or complete.

Mix-ups are also possible and this means that the data we return to
you might be derived from or contaminated by another person's
specimens. For a more detailed summary of potential risks related to
participation in the PGP, you may wish to review Section 6 of the
Consent for Participation:

YOU SHOULD NOT USE EITHER YOUR RETURNED DATA OR YOUR ANALYSIS REPORT
AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE, DIAGNOSIS OR
TREATMENT. IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ANY ASPECT OF YOUR DATA OR
REPORT YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH A LICENSED HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL.
