<%= @user.full_name %>,

This is just a reminder: You claimed a specimen
collection kit recently (nickname "<%= @kit.name -%>")
but as far as we know you have not returned it to us.

If you have already returned it, please update our
database by indicating here that you have done so:

  <%= page_url(:id => 'collection_events', :anchor => 'kits') -%>


Many thanks,

Personal Genome Project Staff
