<p>
Thank you for applying to the Personal Genome Project (PGP) research study.
Your application has been reviewed and a determination has been made.  You are
now enrolled in the Personal Genome Project!
</p>
We ask that you carefully consider the following:
<p>
(1) Public Nature of the PGP: As stated in the consent form, the entrance exam
and on our website, the PGP is a public genomics research study.  As such, you
should understand that the intention of this study is to create a public
repository of genomic, health and other trait information.  If you choose to
continue, your genomic, health and trait data will be made publicly available.
For example, here are two different public websites that contain data from PGP
participant #1 so you can better visualize what this may entail:

<p>
(2) DNA Sequencing:  If you choose to continue in the PGP, we want you to
understand that it may take a considerable amount of time before we are able to
sequence your genome.   Although the cost of whole genome sequencing is
dropping fast, it still costs thousands of dollars per person at the current
market price. Our ability to sequence your genome will depend on our success in
securing funding and sequencing services for the study.  These are all things
we are actively working toward, but it is difficult to predict how long it will
take and there are no guarantees that we will be able to provide DNA sequencing
for every individual who enrolls in the study.  For those individuals that find
themselves on the waitlist to be sequenced, there will be other important ways
to participate in this research study, such as the (a) collection of extensive
health and trait information, (b) evaluation and testing of new software, (c)
feedback about ways to improve the research study, (d) participation in
research studies that are collaborating with the PGP, to name a few.  You
should know that we may shuffle the order of participants as we prioritize the
allocation of DNA sequencing and other resources.
</p>
<p>
(3) Tissue Collection: We realize that Boston may be a long distance from your
home.  We want to limit the amount of time and out-of-pocket expense incurred
by PGP participants.  Although we hope to establish cell lines derived from
skin and/or blood, currently there is no economical way of collecting these
tissues other than requiring that participants travel to Boston at their own
expense.  DNA sequencing, however, can be done using saliva, which can be
collected without an in-person visit.  When we are ready to ship you a saliva
kit, we will request a mailing address and provide further instructions at this
time.
</p>
<p>
(4) Next Steps: We will be continuously adding new features that will enable
you to add new genetic, health and trait data to your public profile and
participate in other aspects of the PGP research study.

<p>Thanks for submitting your enrollment application.  The review process may
take 1-2 months or more.  We will review your application as soon as we can.
Once a determination has been made we will update this page.</p>
