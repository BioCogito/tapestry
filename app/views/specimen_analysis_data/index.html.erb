<h2>Specimen analysis data</h2>

<p>Once the PGP has completed the analysis of your specimen(s), the PGP will make
the data available to you here.  After 30 days, or at your option immediately,
these data will be made available on the PGPâ€™s public website and database and
these data will be associated with your PGP public profile.  During this 30 day
period you may choose to 
<%= link_to('withdraw from the study',edit_user_url(current_user, :anchor => "withdraw")) %> 
and your unpublished specimen analysis data will not be made public.</p>

<p>Please remember that specimen analysis data is for research purposes only.  You
may not use this data for any medical or clinical purpose unless the data are
first confirmed by a licensed healthcare professional. </p>
