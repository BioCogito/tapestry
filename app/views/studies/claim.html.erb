<h2>Claim a kit</h2>

<p>If you have received a sample collection kit in the mail, please
claim your kit here.</p>

<p>Each kit has a nickname, which was randomly chosen from boston area
street names.</p>

<p>You can find your kit&rsquo;s nickname printed on the specimen
tubes (e.g., &ldquo;Kit: Longwood&rdquo;) or on the kit instruction
sheet (e.g., &ldquo;Kit nickname: Longwood&rdquo; -- <%= link_to 'see
picture', image_path('kit_label_circled.png') %>).

<h3>What is the nickname of your kit?</h3>

<%= form_tag kit_claim_path, :method => 'post' do %>
  <div class="field">
    <%= text_field_tag :name %>
    <%= submit_tag("Claim", :name => nil) %>
  </div>
  </p>
