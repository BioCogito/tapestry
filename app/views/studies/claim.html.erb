<h2>Claim a kit</h2>

<p>If you have received a sample collection kit in the mail, please
claim your kit here.</p>

<p>Each kit has a nickname, which was randomly chosen from boston area
street names.</p>

<p>You can find your kit&rsquo;s nickname printed on the specimen
vials (e.g., &ldquo;Kit: Yourkitname&rdquo;).  Please check to make
sure that all vials have the same kit name prior to claiming your
kit.</p>
