<p><strong>What is Informed Consent?</strong><br />
Informed consent means you understand the procedures, risks, possible benefits, and alternatives
before you voluntarily agree to participate in a research study. Before you elect to participate,
you need to understand if or how this study may affect you and your family. This form, along
with other study documents available on the study website (<a href="http://www.personalgenomes.org/">http://www.personalgenomes.org</a>)
(the “website”), is intended to help you make an informed decision about your participation in
this study. The PGP website will be revised as needed, possibly on a frequent basis, and
participants and prospective participants should check the website regularly to obtain the most
current information about this study.
</p>
<p><strong>Why have you been asked to participate in this research study?</strong><br />
You have been invited to participate because you are an individual 21 years of age or older and
your performance on the entrance exam indicates that you are able to give informed consent for
this public and open-ended study. This study (the “Personal Genome Project,” the “PGP,” or the
“study”) is being conducted by researchers at Harvard Medical School specifically for US
Citizens. International activities are coordinated by PersonalGenomes.org, a 501(c)(3) charitable
organization that was created to support the PGP and is independent of Harvard Medical School.
</p>

<p><strong>About this Informed Consent Document</strong><br />

<p><strong><u>I. PURPOSE</u></strong></p>
<p>
The Personal Genome Project is a new form of public genomics research. The main scientific
goal of this study is to find ways to connect human genetic information (i.e., human DNA
sequence) with human trait information (i.e., medical information, tissue samples and physical
traits) in a public way so that such data may be used for research and other scientific, patient care
and commercial purposes worldwide. Additional goals include (i) exploring the risks of public
genomics research such as the PGP; (ii) developing a public dataset of information from willing
participants to aid in the development of analytical tools for scientists, clinicians and individuals;
and (iii) educating participants and the general public about the potential benefits, risks, and
uncertainties posed by the widespread availability of genetic and related information. The PGP
also seeks to develop a model system for experts on health care, molecular biology, genetic
counseling, public health, law, education, and research to come together and collaborate. We
hope that the PGP’s proposed datasets will help to extend such discussions to the creation of case
studies and to find out what individuals, clinicians, and researchers might want or not want in
such datasets, and why.
</p>

<p><strong><u>II. OVERVIEW</u></strong></p>
<p>The PGP will collect tissue samples and personal and trait information from each participant. If
you choose to participate in the study, your genetic and trait information will be made available
through a publicly accessible website and database, according to the procedures described below.
</p>
<p>
If you decide to participate, you will receive certain research data from the PGP (further
described below). Any data or other information that you receive due to your participation in the
study, including DNA sequence data, is not intended to replace in any way professional medical
advice, diagnosis or treatment. You may not use any information you receive from the PGP for
any medical or clinical purpose unless the relevant DNA sequence or other data, including any
interpretations or findings presented in your Preliminary Research Report (described below) are
first confirmed by a licensed healthcare professional.
</p>
<p>
We expect to enroll 100,000 participants in this study, although the pace at which we expand the
study to large numbers of enrollees is unknown.
</p>
<p>
Participation in this study is voluntary. You do not have to participate in the PGP. You may
withdraw from participating in this study at any time, as more fully described in this consent
form.
</p>
<p><strong><u>III. DURATION OF THE PROJECT AND YOUR PARTICIPATION</u></strong></p>
<p>
        3.1 <u>Participation vs. Enrollment.</u> You will be considered a participant of the PGP
from the time that you sign this consent form and submit it to the PGP. Signing and submitting
this consent form does not guarantee your full enrollment in the PGP. Although signing the
consent form means that you are a participant in the PGP, your enrollment in the study is
contingent upon your completion of certain pre-enrollment and enrollment procedures requested
by the PGP (described below), the availability of resources, and any other concerns that the PGP
may have and shares with you.
</p>
<p>
        3.2 <u>Length of Your Participation.</u> Your participation in this project will continue
indefintiely. However your participation is entirely voluntary, and you may refuse to continue
participating and withdraw from this study at any time.
</p>
<p>
        3.3 <u>Length of the Project.</u> The process of analyzing your study data may continue
indefinitely, unless you choose to withdraw or are removed from the PGP. Cell lines and the
public version of your genetic, trait, and other data may be maintained continually (if Harvard
Medical School approves the continuation of the study), unless you request their removal in
writing. At that time your data and/or cell lines will be removed in accordance with this consent
form.
</p>
<p>
        3.4 <u>Naming Your Proxy.</u> Before you enroll in the study you will be asked to name
two people (next of kin or other trusted individual) to be your proxy only for purposes of this
study (your “Designated Proxy”). In the event that you should die or become mentally
incapacitated during the course of your participation in the PGP, your Designated Proxy will
have the authority to decide to either 1) remove your cell lines and/or data from the study
(subject to the limitations on removal described in this consent form), 2) allow the PGP to
maintain your cell lines and/or data for continued research and use in accordance with this
consent form, or 3) authorize the PGP to obtain and add additional data, such as cause of death
and/or tissue samples obtained during an autopsy, to the study on your behalf. You are strongly
encouraged to discuss your wishes with your family and your Designated Proxy as part of your
enrollment in the PGP.
</p>

<p><strong><u>IV. PRE-ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES</u></strong></p>
<p><u>4.1 Collection Of Baseline Trait Data</u><br />
<p>
        (a) <i>Baseline Trait Data.</i> To be considered for enrollment in the PGP, you are
required to collect and electronically submit baseline trait data about yourself, including: date of
birth, medications, allergies, vaccines, personal medical history, race/ethnicity/ancestry, and vital
signs (e.g. height, weight, blood pressure) (the “Baseline Trait Data”). The full list of personal
information required for enrollment may be found on the study website
[http://www.personalgenomes.org/howitworks.html]. Your Baseline Trait Data, along with any
other information that you voluntarily submit to the PGP, will be made available on the PGP’s
public website and database as described in this consent form.
</p>
<p>
        (b) <i>How Baseline Trait Data is Collected.</i> You will submit your Baseline Trait Data
through an electronic health record platform that the PGP will designate from time to time.
Collecting and submitting the Baseline Trait Data will take an estimated 1-3 hours, and that time
may be lost if you are not selected for enrollment. You will not be compensated for any lost
time.
</p>
<p>
        (c) <i>Additional Information Constitute Baseline Trait Data.</i> Additional personal data
(e.g. existing DNA sequencing or genotyping data) and trait information may also be requested
or required by the PGP, such as a facial photograph, family medical history (e.g. data entered
using tools provided by the US Surgeon General [<a href="http://hhs.gov/familyhistory">http://hhs.gov/familyhistory</a>] that aid in the
assessment of heritability of traits), or lifestyle traits in order to be considered for enrollment.
Any such information that you submit will also constitute Baseline Trait Data.
</p>

<p><u>4.2 Identity Verification</u><br />
<p>
        (a) <i>Identity Verification Process.</i> The PGP will ask you to provide your mailing
address (where any pre-enrollment and enrollment materials will be sent, including tissue sample
collection kits) and may ask you to respond to up to 20 questions about your identity based on
information available in public data records.
</p>

<p>
        (b) <i>Additional Verification Steps.</i> If we are unable to verify your identity, we may
request that you send additional information to the PGP by mail, fax, and/or online. If we are
still unable to verify your identity, you will be notified that (1) you must visit a designated
medical center to enroll or (2) your enrollment is rejected.
</p>

<p><u>4.3     Identical (Monozygotic) Twin.</u> If you have any living siblings who are your
identical (monozygotic) twin, such sibling(s) will also need to provide consent for your
participation in this research study before the PGP will consider you for enrollment.

<div class="consent-form-question"> <p>

<!-- , { :checked => (not params[:informed_consent_response]['twin'].nil? and not params[:informed_consent_response]['twin']['false'].nil? ? true : false) } -->

</p> </div>

<p><u>4.4 Application for Enrollment.</u></p>

<p>
        (a) <i>Completion of Application.</i> After you send in your trait information, verify your
identity, and complete any other necessary pre-enrollment activities, your application for
enrollment will be considered by the PGP Executive Committee.
</p>
<p>
        (b) <i>Notification of Enrollment Decision.</i> You will then be notified that you are either:
(1) enrolled, (2) requested to provide additional information to complete your enrollment
application, (3) waitlisted, or (4) rejected.
</p>
<p>
        (c) <i>If You Are Not Enrolled.</i> If you are rejected for enrollment, the PGP will
permanently delete the Baseline Trait Data that you submitted as part of your enrollment
application no later than 6 months from the date PGP tells you that you are not eligible for
enrollment.
</p>

<p><strong><u>V. ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES</u></strong> </p>

<p><u>5.1 Publication of Baseline Trait Data.</u></p>

<p>
        (a) <i>Decision to Publish Baseline Trait Data.</i> Once you are enrolled in the PGP, you
will be given the opportunity to publish your Baseline Trait Data to the PGP’s public website and
database. As a participant in the PGP you will not have the option of selecting portions of your
Baseline Trait Data to publish or not to publish.
</p>
<p>
        (b) <i>No Obligation.</i> As a participant in the PGP you are under no obligation to publish
your Baseline Trait Data. However, you may not be able to participate in other aspects of the
study, including tissue and DNA analysis, until you publish your Baseline Trait Data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
        (c)    If you choose to publish your Baseline Trait Data, they will be made
available to the public through the PGP’s website and database, and combined with other
data and tissues provided by the PGP or by you. There may be risks to you associated with
the publication of your Baseline Trait Data. Those risks are described in Section VII of
this consent form.
</strong>
</p>

<p><u>5.2 Tissue Collection At Home.</u></p>

<p>
        (a) <i>Description of Tissue Collection Steps.</i> Following the publication of your
Baseline Trait Data, you may be sent materials pertaining to at-home tissue sample collection.
These may include a saliva collection kit, a hair collection kit, or other tissue collection kits that
you may self-administer as directed by the PGP. The PGP will provide sample collection
materials, including instructions and mailing packages.
</p>
<p>
        (b) <i>Description of Tissue Collection Materials.</i>
</p>
<div style="padding-left: 60px;">
<p>
                (i)     The saliva sample collection kit may be self-administered and typically
        requires you to provide 2-4 milliliters of your saliva. The sample will be used for the
        production of DNA sequence data and other data.
</p>
<p>
                (ii)    The hair sample collection kit may be self-administered and requires 1-5
        hairs to be plucked from your body. The skin cells (i.e., keratinocytes) attached to the
        hair sample will be used to create a living tissue sample known as a cell line. Cell lines
        provide a renewable supply of your cells and DNA. The PGP may attempt to make cell
        lines from your hair sample once it is received but cannot make any guarantees about
        how long this will take, or if it will even be possible to make a cell line.
</p>
</div>
<p>
        (c) <i>No Obligation.</i> As a participant in the Personal Genome Project you are under no
obligation to submit any tissue samples to the study as described above. However, you may not
be able to participate in other aspects of the study, including tissue, cell line and DNA analysis,
until you have submitted such additional tissue samples.
</p>

<p><u>5.3     Tissue Collection at a Medical Center; Interview.</u></p>
<p>
       (a) <i>Tissue Collection at a Medical Center.</i> You may be asked to visit a designated
medical center approved by the study and an Institutional Review Board for the purpose of tissue
sample collection. The PGP will provide instructions about scheduling an appointment.
</p>
<p>
       (b) <i>Description of Tissues Collected.</i> The PGP may ask that you provide skin or
blood samples during your visit to the medical center. These samples will be collected through
either (i) a skin biopsy procedure, and/or (ii) a blood draw. If you consent, these procedures will
be performed at the medical center by trained professionals appointed by the PGP.
</p>
<div style="padding-left: 60px;">
<p>
                 (i)    A skin punch biopsy (1/16 inch = 1.5 mm diameter and 1/3 inch = 8 mm
        deep) is collected from the underside of the upper arm or hip and requires local
        anesthesia. Anesthetic cream is applied and covered with a bandage for 40 minutes then
        wiped off and alcohol swabbed to sterilize. Then a sterile stainless steel punch will be
        inserted to a depth of 0.8 mm and the skin sample removed. Then a bandage will be
        applied.
</p>
<p> 
                (ii)   A blood sample is collected from your upper arm and requires a minimum
        of 5ml of blood.
</p>
<p>
                 (iii) The skin cells (i.e., fibroblasts) or blood (i.e., lymphoblasts) that you
        provide will be used to create a living tissue sample known as a cell line. Cell lines
        provide a renewable supply of your cells and DNA.
</p>
</div>
<p>
        (c) <i>No Obligation.</i> As a participant in the PGP you are under no obligation to submit
any additional tissue samples to the study as part of your visit to a medical center or otherwise.
However, you may not be able to participate in other aspects of the study, including tissue, cell
line and DNA analysis, until you have submitted such additional tissue samples.
</p>
<p>
        (d) <i>In Person Interview.</i> During your visit to the medical center for additional tissue
sample collection you may also be asked to meet with a member of the PGP staff to confirm that
you are familiar with the study protocols, including this consent form, and to review and confirm
your identity and the accuracy of your Baseline Trait Data. The interview will take
approximately 1 hour.
</p>
<p>
        (e) <i>Costs Incurred Are Not Reimbursed.</i> Please review the locations of participating
medical centers because they may be located a long distance from your home. The PGP will not
reimburse you for any costs you may incur traveling to or from the medical center. A list of
participating medical centers may be found on the PGP website. Costs that you might incur the
day of your visit to a medical center include, but are not limited to, transportation costs to and
from the medical center (tolls, gas, etc.) and the loss of personal time. You will not be paid or
reimbursed for these or for any other costs associated with your visit.
</p>

<p><u>5.4    Generation of DNA Sequence Data.</u></p>
<p>
       (a) <i>How Analysis is Performed.</i> DNA analysis and other research will be performed
by the PGP on the tissue samples you provide and/or the cell lines and/or data created from such
samples. PGP will determine kind of research and analysis to be conducted.
</p>
<p>
       (b) <i>No Guarantees.</i> The PGP cannot make any guarantees about the accuracy or
completeness of any such analysis or research or the processing time for any of these activities.
</p>

<p><u>5.5    Return and Publication of DNA Sequence Data.</u></p>
<p>
        (a) <i>Receipt of Your DNA Sequence Data.</i> Once the PGP has completed DNA
analysis of your sample(s), the PGP will make your DNA sequence data available to you via a
password protected area on the PGP website. This information is for research purposes only.
You may not use this data for any medical or clinical purpose unless the DNA sequence or other
data, including any interpretations or findings presented in your Preliminary Research Report
(described below), are first confirmed by a licensed healthcare professional. You can find
examples of DNA sequence data similar to what you will receive as an enrollee on the study
website.
</p>
<p>
        (b) <i>Receipt and Review of Your Preliminary Research Report.</i> In addition to your
DNA sequence data, the PGP will provide you with a preliminary research report (the
“Preliminary Research Report” or the “Report”) intended to help you make a more informed
decision about whether or not to publish your DNA sequence data to the PGP’s public website
and database. This Report will contain a non-comprehensive list of genetic variants present in
your DNA sequence data, as well as any additional information, resources or interpretation that
the PGP may decide to provide to you as part of your Report. In preparing your Report, the PGP
may review your DNA sequence data in combination with the trait data and other information
that you have submitted to the PGP.
</p>

<div style="padding-left: 60px;">
<p>
        (i)    The Preliminary Research Report includes preliminary research findings
only. The PGP cannot guarantee that the Report is either accurate or complete. The
databases, knowledge and tools used to generate the Report are not comprehensive and
may change from time to time. Only one Preliminary Research Report will be provided
to you. The PGP will not update or supplement the Report.
</p>
<p>
        (ii)       The Preliminary Research Report is not intended to substitute in any way
for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. You may not use the Report for
any medical or clinical purpose unless the relevant sequence or other data, including any
interpretations or findings presented in your Preliminary Research Report, are first
confirmed by a licensed healthcare professional.
</p>
<p>
        (iii) Examples of other Reports similar to what you may receive as an enrollee
are available on the study website.
</p>
</div>
<p>
        (c) <i>Decision to Publish DNA Sequence Data.</i> After you receive your DNA sequence
data and your Preliminary Research Report, you will be able to choose whether to (i) make your
DNA sequence data available on the PGP’s public website and database, or (ii) withdraw from
the PGP. If you choose to publish your DNA sequence data, the PGP will make this data
available on its public website and database and this data will be associated with your Baseline
Trait Data along with any other data supplied by you or the PGP.
</p>
<p>
        (d) <i>No Obligation.</i> You are not obligated to publish or to take any other action with
respect to your DNA sequence data. However, if you elect not to publish your DNA sequence
data you may not be permitted to continue to participate in the study.
</p>
<p>
        (e) <i>Updating Your DNA Sequence Data.</i> If you choose to publish your DNA
sequence data, the PGP may re-process and supplement your DNA sequence data from time time
as new data, information or techniques become available. If you consented to the publication of
your original DNA sequence data, then the PGP may publish your re-processed and/or
supplemented DNA sequence data directly to the PGP’s public website and database without
your further consent. You will not be provided an additional or revised Preliminary Research
Report or other analysis of your DNA sequence data, and you will not be given an opportunity to
choose whether or not to publish your re-processed and/or supplemented DNA sequence data.
</p>
<p>
        (f) <strong>By signing this consent form, you authorize the PGP to do the following: if
after reviewing your Preliminary Research Report you inform the PGP that you will allow
the PGP to publish your DNA sequence data and other personal information, the PGP may
publish such data and information (including your DNA sequence data, whether or not re-
processed and/or supplemented, and your Preliminary Research Report), along with your
trait information and any other information you have submitted to the PGP. This means
that the PGP may proceed to publish this data and information without your being asked
to sign any additional consent. The PGP will publish the data and information on a
publicly accessible website and database. It may also publish the data and information in
other formats and/or media. Your ability to withdraw your consent once the PGP has
published all or some of this data and information is limited, and is described in Section XI
of this consent form. There may be risks to you associated with the publication of this data
and information. Those risks are described in Section VII of this consent form.
</strong>
</p>

<p><u>5.6    Creation, Distribution and Analysis of Cell Lines.</u></p>
<p>
         (a) <i>How Your Tissue Samples Are Used.</i> Tissue samples submitted to the PGP will
be used by the PGP for a range of research purposes, including (i) creation of cell lines,
(ii) transformation into somatic cell-derived stem cells (i.e., induced pluripotent stem cells or iPS
cells, which are cells with the ability to divide for indefinite periods and to give rise to
specialized cells), and (iii) the study of biological characteristics, including DNA, RNA (gene
expression), physical traits, and the presence and characteristics of micro-organisms and viruses
in the specimen samples.
</p>
<p>
         (b) <i>Creation of Cell Lines From Your Tissues.</i> If you consent to participate in this
study and are enrolled, the PGP may create or attempt to create cell lines from your tissue
samples. Any cells derived from such tissue samples will be stored and maintained by the PGP,
Coriell National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) biorepository and/or other
biorepositories chosen by the PGP and approved by Harvard Medical School, unless you request
that the cells be destroyed as part of your withdrawal from this study. A biorepository is a cell
culture and storage facility where your cells will be expanded in number using cell culture,
stored in liquid nitrogen and shipped to authorized researchers. The PGP will not create or
attempt to create new cell lines for any individual who has withdrawn from the study.
</p>
<p>
         (c) <i>No Guarantees.</i> The PGP cannot make any guarantees about how long it will
take to create a cell line from your tissues, or if it will even be possible to make such a cell line.
</p>

<p>
        (d) <i>Distribution of Cell Lines.</i> Cell lines provide a renewable supply of your cells
and DNA. Cell lines will be sent to and stored by the Coriell NIGMS repository and/or other
biorepositories the PGP chooses consistent with the PGP’s research goals. Your cell lines will
not be made available for distribution to third parties until after you have agreed to the
publication of your DNA sequence data to the PGP’s public website and database. The PGP will
select biorepositories to store and distribute your cells lines that have agreed to follow applicable
and appropriate best practices for donation, procurement, culture, and storage of cells and tissues
to ensure, in particular, the traceability of stem cells. The use of these repositories will be
approved by Harvard Medical School.
</p>
<p>
        (e) <i>Use of Cell Lines.</i> Cell lines may be made available by the PGP to third parties
under agreements approved and entered into by the PGP without your additional notification or
consent. These agreements may permit your cell lines to be used for research, patient care,
commercial or other purposes, including genetic manipulation of the cells or mixing of human
and nonhuman cells in animal models. Neither you nor the PGP will be able to restrict or specify
the type of research or other purposes for which your cell lines will or will not be used. Other
than for purposes of cost recovery, the PGP will not license or otherwise make participant cell
lines available to any third party for the financial gain or commercial profit of the PGP.
</p>
<p>
        (f) <i>Return of Analyses Performed on Cell Lines.</i>
<div style="padding-left: 60px;">
<p>
                (i)      Generally, the PGP will not provide you with the results of any analysis,
        development or other work performed by third parties with access to your tissues or cell
        lines. However, because such results may be made publicly available, and may be
        identified as deriving from your tissues or cell lines, you may become aware, even
        without your consent, of the results of such activities.
</p>
<p>
                (ii)     The PGP may decide to return to you certain results deriving from your
        tissues or cell lines. The PGP is not obligated to return any such results to you. The PGP
        may request that you voluntarily choose whether to make such results available, along
        with your genetic and trait data, on the PGP’s public website and database.
</p>
</div>
<p>
        (g) <strong>By signing this consent form, you authorize the PGP to distribute to others,
in a manner consistent with the conditions described above, the cell lines created from your
tissues without further notice to you and without the PGP obtaining any additional consent
from you. Your ability to withdraw from the portion of this study that involves the
distribution of your cell lines is limited once your cells lines have been created and
distributed, and is described in Section XI of this consent form. There may be risks to you
associated with the creation and distribution of your cell lines. Those risks are described in
Section VII of this consent form.</strong>
</p>

<p><strong><u>VI. ONGOING PARTICIPATION FOLLOWING ENROLLMENT</u></strong></p>

<p>
       6.2 <u>Additional Trait Collection.</u> Additional personal and trait data may be requested
by the PGP and submitted by you on a voluntary basis. Any additional data disclosed by you
may be made publicly available by the PGP via the public website and database without your
additional consent and will be associated with your previously published data.
</p>
<p>
       6.3 <u>Additional Tissue Specimen Collection.</u> Additional tissue samples, such as inner
cheek swabs, skin swabs, hair samples, saliva samples, urine samples and/or fecal samples, may
be requested by the PGP and submitted by you on a voluntary basis. Any additional samples you
provide may be analyzed or otherwise incorporated into the study. The results may be made
publicly available by the PGP via the public website and database and associated with your
previously published data.
</p>
<p>
       6.4 <u>Additional Return and Release of Research Data.</u> The PGP may, but is not
required to, return to you certain research results or analysis generated by the PGP or by anyone
accessing your public PGP data. The PGP may request that you voluntarily choose whether or
not to make such results available, along with your other information already on the PGP’s
public website and database.
</p>
<p>
       6.5 <u>Safety Questionnaires.</u>
</p>
<p>
       (a) <i>Contents of the Safety Questionnaire.</i> Every 3 months the PGP will circulate a
questionnaire (the “Safety Questionnaire”) to all participants and request that each participant
answer the following questions:
</p>
<div style="padding-left: 60px;">
<p>
        (i)     What negative and/or positive events have happened to you and/or your
relatives or acquaintances due to your participation in the PGP?
</p>
<p>
        (ii)    What are the reactions or responses of your relatives and acquaintances to
the publication of your genetic, trait and other data?
</p>
<p>
        (iii) Please report incidents of being contacted by acquaintances or by strangers
(including researchers, health care providers or members of the media) regarding your
data being published online.
</p>
<p>
        (iv)    In what ways has this study positively or negatively influenced your
interactions with your medical care providers or your receipt of or access to health care
services?
</p>
<p>
        (v)     Has your involvement in this study triggered the need for any health or
medical care that would not otherwise have been done? If you answer “yes,” please
describe (a) the specific medical intervention or care you received, and (b) the findings or
consequences of the medical intervention or care you received with regard to your health.
        Health or medical care that would have been performed had you not participated in this
        study, whether due to symptoms, a personal or family medical history, routine screening
        or any other reason, should not be included.
</p>
</div>
<p>
        (b) <i>Prompt Return Required.</i> You are required to return the completed Safety
Questionnaire or a “no change” reply be sent to the PGP within 1 week of receipt.
</p>
<p>
        (c) <i>Reporting of Unexpected Events.</i> You are requested to immediately report to the
PGP any unexpected events that you may experience as a participant in the study
</p>
<p>
        (d) <i>Periodic Reflection.</i> At 5 year intervals, and at the end of your participation in the
study, you will be requested to write your thoughts about the PGP overall, including whether this
consent form adequately described the procedures and risks associated with your participation.
</p>
<p>
        (e) <i>Changes to the Questionnaire.</i> The Safety Questionnaire, including the number
of questions and the frequency of circulation to enrollees, may be modified by the PGP from
time to time.
</p>

<p><strong><u>VII. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS</u></strong></p>
<p>
The Personal Genome Project is a new form of public genomics research and, as a result, it is
impossible to accurately predict all of the possible risks and discomforts that you might
experience as a result of your participation in this study. In this section you will read about the
risks that we have identified as potentially relevant to your participation in the PGP.
</p>
<p>
You are strongly encouraged to think carefully about these risks, as well as any other risks or
discomforts that you anticipate might arise as a result of your own unique circumstances. These
might include your own health or medical conditions, your family and personal relationships or
any other factor that is specific to you. In addition to understanding the risks outlined in this
Section VII, you should feel confident that you have sufficient knowledge (via the educational
and testing materials available on the PGP website) of genetics, human subjects research and the
benefits and risks of participation in this study to make an informed decision about whether
participation is right for you.
</p>
<p>
You are strongly encouraged to discuss this study and its potential risks with your immediate
family members as well as with your physician and/or other qualified health care providers. You
are also encouraged to discuss with the Principal Investigator directly any additional concerns
that you may have regarding the risks to you of participating in this study.
</p>
<p>
Finally, because the science in this area is evolving, and data will be collected on an ongoing
basis by the PGP, the risks involved due to your participation in this study, as well as the
likelihood and severity of such risks, will change over time. You will not be asked to review and
re-sign this consent form every time new information related to the risk of participation becomes
available. However, the PGP will try to update this consent form and the study website as
frequently as possible to reflect the latest information about the risks of participation.
Participants and prospective participants are strongly encouraged to check the website regularly
and to update their contact information with the PGP in order to obtain the most current
information regarding the risks and discomforts of participation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Please remember that you are free not to participate if you have not already enrolled, and
to withdraw at any time if you have already enrolled in the study.</strong>
</p>

<p> 7.1    <u>Risks Associated with the Publication of Your Data.</u>  </p>
<p>
       (a) <i>Risks Associated with Public Disclosure.</i> The risks of public disclosure of your
genetic and trait data, including your Baseline Trait Data, any additional trait data or other
information you provide, and your DNA sequence data, could affect your employment, insurance
and financial well-being or social interactions for you and your immediate family. The
following is a non-comprehensive list of hypothetical scenarios that could pose risks for you
and/or your family:
</p>
<div style="padding-left: 60px;">
<p>
              (i)     Data that you provide (such as facial images, other trait data or DNA
       sequence data) may be used to identify you, resulting in higher than normal levels of
       contacts from the press and other members of the public motivated by positive or
       negative feelings about the study. This could mean a significant loss of privacy and
       personal time.
</p>
<p>
              (ii)    Data that you provide may cause you to learn – either directly or from a
       family member or other individual – that you are not related to family members or other
       individuals in the way that you had previously believed. This could also include
       inferences or allegations of paternity made by individuals you did not previously know or
       suspect were related to you.
</p>
<p>
              (iii) Anyone with sufficient knowledge and resources could take your DNA
       sequence data and/or posted trait information and use that data, with or without changes,
       to :
</p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 120px;">
<p>
                      (1) infer paternity or other genealogical features of you and/or your
                      family,
</p>
<p>
                      (2) claim statistical evidence that could affect the ability of you or your
                      family to obtain or maintain employment, insurance or financial services,
</p>
<p>
                      (3) claim relatedness to criminals or incriminate relatives,
</p>
<p>
                      (4) make synthetic DNA and plant it at a crime scene, or otherwise use it
                      to falsely identify you, or
</p>
<p>
                      (5) reveal to you or a member of your family the possibility of a disease or
                      unknown propensity for a disease.
</p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 60px;">
<p>
              (iv) Whether or not it is lawful to do so, you could be subject to actual or
       attempted employment, insurance, financial, or other forms of discrimination or negative
       treatment due to the public disclosure of your genetic and trait information by the PGP or
        by a third party. Although the United States has a law that bars certain forms of genetic
        discrimination (the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, also known as GINA),
        this law does not apply to the use of genetic information in all circumstances and, even
        where it does apply, it does not guarantee that your genetic information will not be used
        against you in a way that you feel is discriminatory or otherwise harmful to you and/or
        your family.
</p>
<p>
                (v)      If you have previously made available or intend to make available genetic
        information in a confidential setting, for example in another research study, the data that
        you provide as part of the PGP may be used, on its own or in combination with your
        previously shared data, to identify you as a participant in otherwise confidential genetic
        research or trials. This means that any data or other information you may have shared
        pursuant to a promise of confidentiality or privacy may become public despite your intent
        that they be kept private and confidential. This could result in certain adverse effects for
        you, including ones not considered by this consent form.
</p>
<p>
                (vi)     Your publicly available DNA sequence data, trait data and other
        information may also include information that applies to your family members. Some
        people may draw conclusions from your publicly available information, including
        speculating about what such information might reveal about you and your family
        members. As a result, the PGP cannot predict all of the risks, or the severity of the risks,
        that the public availability of this information may pose to you and your relatives. You
        are strongly encouraged to discuss this study and its potential risks, including the fact that
        not all of the risks are known, with your immediate family members.
</p>
</div>
<p>
        (b) <i>Possibility of Unintended Public Disclosure.</i> If you enroll in the PGP research
study and, based on your review of your Preliminary Research Report or otherwise, choose not
to publish your DNA sequence data, it is still possible that your DNA sequence data will be
publicly disclosed due to unintended data breaches, including hacking or other activities outside
of the procedures authorized by the PGP. Should this occur you would be subject to the various
risks and discomforts described in this section and throughout this consent form even though you
did not intend for your DNA sequence data to be published.
</p>
<p>
        (c) <i>Reproduction or Modification of your Data.</i> If you choose to make your DNA
sequence data and other information available, it will be published on the PGP's publicly
accessible website and database and be openly available to third parties. As a result, neither you
nor the PGP will be able to control or restrict the access, use, reproduction, modification, or
analysis of your data and other public information. Your data and other public information may
be made public in other forms in addition to its inclusion in the PGP database. It may also be
changed, without either your or the PGP’s consent, in a way that might be inaccurate and or
upsetting to you. For example, a third party could access your publicly available sequence data
or other information, change it and republish it to suggest that you had a propensity for a disease
or other detrimental trait. Additional adverse effects are also possible.
</p>
<p> 7.2 <u>Risks Associated with the Creation of Cell Lines From Your Tissues.</u></p>
<p>
         (a) <i>Undesirable Uses or Research - Possibility of Use for Cloning.</i> The distribution
of your cell lines could result in the creation and further distribution by a third party of additional
cell lines, organs or tissues containing your DNA for research, commercial, patient care, or other
uses, including certain forms of assisted reproduction. You may not like or be upset by some of
these uses. If scientific technology continues to evolve, it may one day be possible for a third
party to use, without your or the PGP’s authorization, cell lines or biological materials derived
from your cell lines for new or unexpected reproductive or other purposes, including cloning.
You may be made aware, without your consent, of the results of such research, commercial,
clinical, or other uses, whether or not authorized, of your cell lines.
</p>
<p>
         (b) <i>Inability to Control Access to Cell Lines.</i> Cell lines deposited in and distributed
by the Coriell NIGMS repository and/or other biorepositories designated by the PGP, or by the
PGP itself, may be made available to other researchers or groups subject to Coriell’s and their
own institutional review processes. However, it is impossible to guarantee that all cell line
recipients will not share materials with, and will protect such materials from access by,
unauthorized individuals. As a result, the PGP cannot provide any guarantees about the people
who may receive access to your cell lines, or the research or other uses of your cell lines by such
individuals.
</p>
<p>
         (c) <i>Pluripotent Stem Cells – Potential Use for Cloning and Other Research Purposes.</i>
The PGP may use the cells taken from the materials you provide to create a type of cell known as
a pluripotent cell. This type of cell can be used to create different types of tissues. Your cells
might be used in research involving genetic alteration of the cells. Your cells might be mixed
with other human cells, mixed with animal cells, or grown in lab animals like mice. Your cells
might also be used to reproduce tissue and cells, including for the purpose of human cloning.
</p>
<p> 7.3 <u>Risks Associated with Your Receipt of Data From the PGP.</u></p>
<p>
         (a) <i>Data Quality Not Guaranteed.</i> The PGP cannot guarantee that any research data,
including your DNA sequence data and your Preliminary Research Report, provided to you by
the PGP are true and correct.
</p>
<p>
         (b) <i>Data Not to be Used for Medical Care.</i> The data provided to you by the PGP,
including your DNA sequence data and your Preliminary Research Report, are not an appropriate
substitute for professional medical or clinical advice, diagnosis or treatment, and may not be
used by you for any medical or clinical purpose unless the relevant sequence or other data,
including any interpretations or findings presented in your Preliminary Research Report, are first
confirmed by a licensed healthcare professional.
</p>
<div style="padding-left: 60px;">
<p>
                 (i)     Doctors do not routinely screen DNA sequence data for genetic variations
         as part of patient care. The clinical importance of this data is not known with any
         certainty at this time. In addition, although there is considerable information about
         possible connections between genetic information, some of these connections, especially
         when screened for in the general population, remain uncertain.
</p>
<p>
                (ii)    Regardless of any specific interpretations or findings included or not
        included in your Preliminary Research Report, you are likely to be subjected to additional
        interpretations – both accurate and inaccurate – of your public data by people outside of
        the project.
</p>
</div>
<p>
        (c) <i>Risks Due to Pursuing Health or Medical Care.</i> If your Preliminary Research
Report contains information about potentially harmful genetic variants, you may experience
anxiety or stress. As a result, you may want to seek health or medical care or counseling to
verify the accuracy of such interpretations, whether provided by the PGP or by other sources. If
you choose to pursue health or medical care or counseling, you could be exposed to additional
risks and/or discomforts, several of which are identified below.
</p>
<p>
        (d) <i>The PGP Does Not Provide and Is Not Responsible For Your Health or Medical
Care.</i> The PGP will not (i) provide you with, (ii) arrange for, (iii) pay for, reimburse you for or
otherwise subsidize or (iv) provide you, your physician or any other health care provider with
any recommendations, advice or other guidance with respect to, any of your health or medical
care, including any current or follow-up medical or clinical advice, diagnosis or treatment,
preventative action or other related course of action of any kind.
</p>
<div style="padding-left: 60px;">
<p>
                (i) The PGP is not responsible for any part of your health or medical care,
        including, accurately predicting disease or disease risk, informing you of genetic
        variations, or providing you with accurate and valid DNA sequence data or
        interpretations of your DNA sequence data. No health or medical care will be made
        available by the PGP and, as described above, no special arrangements, for compensation
        or otherwise, will be made by the PGP should you require or choose to pursue any health
        or medical care as a result of your participation in the PGP.
</p>
<p>
                (ii)    You should talk to your doctor or other qualified health care provider if
        you have questions about any information provided to you by the PGP, including your
        DNA sequence data or Preliminary Research Report. You should not ignore professional
        medical advice from your doctor or any other qualified health care provider about any
        information included or not included in your Preliminary Research Report or in other
        information provided to you by the PGP. You should not interpret your DNA sequence
        data or your Report as recommending or discouraging any specific treatment plan,
        product, or course of action with respect to your health or medical care.
</p>
<p>
                (iii) In the event that you, after talking with your doctor or other qualified
        health care provider, decide that any change in your health or medical care is necessary or
        advisable as a result of any information you received as a participant in the PGP, you (or
        your third party payer (i.e. your health care insurance provider), if applicable) will be
        solely responsible for all resulting payments and costs associated with such health or
        medical care.
</p>
<p>
                (iv)    Any health or medical care that you may determine, after consultation
        with your doctor or other qualified health care provider, is necessary, whether as a result
        of your participation in this study or otherwise, may be invasive and have its own
        associated risks and expenses. Serious risks, including death, may be involved in any
such health or medical care. You should carefully consider these risks, as well as
whether you have the financial and other resources necessary to pursue such health or
medical care.
</p>
<p>
        (v)    If your doctor or other qualified health care provider is directly or
indirectly involved with the PGP, as either a researcher or a participant, any health or
medical care that you receive from such health care provider, including medical advice or
clinical management, represents health or medical care provided by that provider
pursuant to your existing doctor-patient relationship, and is not health or medical care
provided by the PGP.
</p>
</div>

<p>7.4 <u>Physical Risks and Discomforts.</u></p>
<p>
        (a)      There are no known or foreseeable risks or side effects associated with obtaining
saliva, hair, inner cheek swab, skin swab, urine, or fecal samples. The blood draw and skin
biopsy may involve a small amount of pain, bleeding and/or fainting, and may also cause
temporary bruising and/or infection at the site of puncture. Some degree of permanent scarring
can be expected from the skin biopsy procedure as described in Section 5.3.
</p>
<p>
        (b)      If you are physically injured as a result or your participation in this study, please
seek medical care immediately and contact the Principal Investigator. The PGP will not provide
any health or medical care to participants.
</p>
<p> 7.5 <u>Data Safety Monitoring Board.</u> A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will
monitor the progress of the PGP, including the risks to study participants. Although the PGP
will try to tell you about any additional risks identified by the DSMB, including through updates
to the study website, the DSMB will not be able to monitor all of the risks of participation in this
study, and it may not be able to advise you or the PGP of those risks that it monitors or identifies.
</p>

<p><strong><u>VIII. BENEFITS</u></strong></p>
<p>
        8.1 <i>No Benefits to You.</i> You are not likely to benefit in any way as a result of your
participation in the PGP.
</p>

<p><strong><u>IX. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</u></strong></p>

<p>
        9.1 <u>Promoting Open Access.</u> One of the primary goals of the PGP is to develop a
public dataset of information from willing participants to aid in the development of analytical
tools and interfaces for scientists, doctors, and individuals around the world. In order to
accomplish this, the PGP will endeavor to develop data structures and other tools, including legal
agreements, to maximize the ability of the study to share its data in the broadest possible fashion.
</p>
<p>
        9.2 <u>Ownership of Your Information and Data.</u> The PGP will not attempt to claim that
it owns any information or data that you provide directly to the PGP as part of your participation
in the study. However, the PGP will proceed to use such information or data without restriction
including, without limitation, copying, distributing, transmitting, publicly displaying, publicly
performing, publishing, reproducing, editing, translating, reformatting, and creating derivative
works, subject only to your ability to withdraw from the study, as that ability is described in this
consent form. Any tissue samples or specimens that you provide to the PGP as part of your
participation in this study, including saliva, hair, blood or other biological tissues, are the
property of and are owned by the PGP and not by you. Any information, data or materials
created or prepared by the PGP from such tissue samples or specimens, including, without
limitation, your DNA sequence data, Preliminary Research Report, cell lines and the results of
any research or analysis performed by or in collaboration with the PGP, are the property of and
owned by the PGP and not by you. However, consistent with the goals of the PGP and this
consent form, the PGP will attempt to make this information, data or materials, including your
DNA sequence data, Preliminary Research Report and cell lines, available to you and/or to the
public as described in this consent form. It will be the PGP’s decision whether to make available
to you and/or publish such information, data and materials. The PGP is unable to guarantee if,
when or in what form you will receive access to any information, data or materials as part of
your participation in this study.
</p>
<p>
        9.3 <u>No Licensing for Profit.</u> Other than for purposes of recovering its costs, neither
the PGP nor PersonalGenomes.org will license or otherwise make available your tissue
specimens, cell lines, DNA samples, DNA sequence data, and personal information to any
person, institution, company or other third party for the financial gain or commercial profit of the
PGP or PersonalGenomes.org. However, information and materials that you provide, including
DNA sequence data and cell lines derived from your tissue specimens, may be made available to
third parties for research, patient care, commercial or other purposes, and these third parties may
commercially profit from the data or other information that you contribute to the PGP.
</p>
<p>
        9.4 <u>No Compensation.</u> You will not be paid for your participation in the PGP. The
results of studies using materials provided by you, such as your stem cells, may have commercial
potential. Neither you nor your heirs will receive financial or any other benefits from any
discoveries, whether or not of a commercial nature, made using the information and/or
specimens that you provide.
</p>

<p><strong><u>X. CONFIDENTIALITY</u></strong></p>
<p>
        10.1 <u>No Confidentiality After Publication.</u> If you are enrolled in the PGP and choose
to publish any of your data to the PGP’s public website and database, that data will not be kept or
made available by the PGP in a confidential or anonymous fashion. The PGP will not require
any collaborators or other individuals accessing your information to keep the information in a
confidential or anonymous fashion. Unless you withdraw from the study before your data are
published, your genetic and trait data will be made available via a publicly accessible website
and database.
</p>
<p>
        10.2 <u>Association of Your Name With Your Data.</u> The PGP will not intentionally
associate your name with your genomic or trait data or other information that is published to the
PGP’s public website and database. The PGP will not intentionally publicly identify you by
name as a participant in the PGP without your prior consent. However, as described above,
because of the identifiable nature of the information you are providing to the study and generated
about you by the study, it is possible that one or more third parties may identify you as a
participant in the PGP and associate your published data and information with your name or
other information that you have not provided to the PGP and may not have wished to be publicly
disclosed.
</p>
<p>
        10.3 <u>Efforts to Preserve Confidentiality Prior to Publication.</u> During the enrollment
process, and before your publication of your Baseline Trait Data or DNA sequence data, as
applicable, the PGP will use reasonable efforts to preserve the privacy and confidentiality of
such data, as well as other information you provide to the PGP (your Preliminary Research
Report, for example). However, you should be aware that public disclosure of such information,
even if you have not yet completed enrollment, ultimately determine not to publish such data, or
decide to withdraw from the study, may still happen due to unintended data breaches, including
hacking or other activities outside of the procedures described in this consent form. For this
reason the PGP cannot guarantee that information you provide to the study, or that is generated
about you by the study, will be maintained in a confidential manner.
</p>
<p>
        10.4 <u>No Direct Disclosure to Your Health Care Provider.</u> Your genetic and trait data
will not be sent to your health care provider directly by the PGP and will not become part of your
medical record due to any activities of the PGP. However, because this information will be
publicly available, and may be identified as yours, it could become part of your medical record
or be shared with your doctor or other health care provider or your health care insurance
provider, or provided to others due to the activities of one or more third parties.
</p>
<p>
        10.5 <u>Replies to Safety Questionnaires.</u> Your replies to the Safety Questionnaires will
be confidential. However, the DSMB or governmental agencies may request or require this
information in order to judge the risks to you and any other study participants. The PGP will
share your replies to the Safety Questionnaire with them to the extent required or reasonably
requested.
</p>
<p>
        (a) <i>Publication of Responses.</i> Responses to the Safety Questionnaires that may
impact other PGP participants, or the public generally, will be paraphrased or will have all
information reasonably likely to identify you removed prior to making this information available
on the public website or elsewhere for purposes of public education or risk management. If you
would like your answers to be identified as yours, you may indicate that preference as part of
your response to the Safety Questionnaires. Although the PGP will take reasonable steps to
ensure that your responses to Safety Questionnaires, if published, are not identified as yours
without your consent, the PGP is unable to guarantee the anonymity of your responses.
</p>
<p>
        (b) <i>Publication of Results.</i> The results of this study may be published in a medical
book, journal, website or webpage, or used for teaching purposes. Identifying information that is
associated with your data and/or the results of this study (such as your photograph, DNA
sequence data, and medical or trait information, as well as your name if that has become
associated with your study data by a third party during the course of your participation in the
PGP), may be used in such publications or teaching materials. The PGP will not notify you prior
to such uses.
</p>

<p><strong><u>XI. REFUSAL OR WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPATION</u></strong></p>

<p>
        11.1 <u>Voluntary Participation.</u> Participation in this study is voluntary. You do not have
to participate in the PGP. You may withdraw from participating and/or withdraw your data from
this study at any time. You will never have to provide a reason for your withdrawal.
</p>
<p>
        11.2 <u>Limitations on Withdrawal.</u> You are free to decide at any time that you no longer
want your tissue samples, DNA sequence data, cell lines or other information to be used as part
of this study, but it may not be possible to prevent the future use of your data and/or information
in certain circumstances:
</p>
<p>
        (a) <i>Deletion of Trait and Sequence Data.</i> If you choose to withdraw from the study
and request that your genetic and trait data to be removed, within 6 months the PGP will delete
all DNA sequence and trait data about you and held by the PGP. The PGP will also request any
organizations or researchers with whom the PGP has any formal data sharing agreements to
likewise delete your data and information within a reasonable time frame. However, once any
data or information you provide to the PGP during the course of your participation in the study is
posted to the PGP’s public website and/or database, other organizations and individuals who
have no formal data sharing agreement with the PGP may acquire copies of it. There will be no
way to ensure that they will delete their copies of your data or information, or for the PGP to
even know what copies of your data or information may exist. Also, your data may be combined
by the PGP and/or its collaborators or third parties in ways that will make it impossible to delete
them from such datasets.
</p>
<p>
        (b) <i>Destruction of Tissue Samples and Cell Lines.</i> If you decide to withdraw from
participation and request that the PGP remove cell lines created from your tissues, the PGP will
destroy all tissue samples and cell lines held by the PGP and send a notice to all biorepositories
with which the PGP has formal agreements requesting that such biorepositories destroy your cell
lines. However, once tissue samples and/or cell lines have been distributed, the ability to control
their use by you, the PGP or the biorepository to which they were distributed will be limited.
Because your cell lines and/or tissue samples may have been widely distributed, it may not be
possible to retrieve and/or destroy all copies of your cell lines and/or tissue samples.
</p>
<p>
        11.3 <u>Removal from the Study.</u> The PGP may decide to end your participation in this
study at any time. If the PGP terminates your participation, it will provide you with an
explanation for its doing so. If you are refused enrollment in the PGP, or your participation in
the PGP is terminated by the PGP, you may ask that the PGP destroy any of your tissue samples
and/or cell lines, and delete any of your data in accordance with the provisions set forth above.
If neither you nor your Designated Proxy request that your tissue samples and/or cell lines be
destroyed and your data be deleted upon your removal from the study, the PGP may elect, in its
discretion, to maintain your tissues, cell lines and/or data for use by the study consistent with this
consent form.
</p>
<p>
        11.4 <u>Failure to Complete Safety Questionnaires.</u> Your participation in the PGP may be
ended if you do not comply with the instructions related to Safety Questionnaires, as described
above.
</p>
<p>
        11.5 <u>Maintenance of Certain Information.</u> If you decide to withdraw, or if the PGP
ends your participation, the PGP may continue to keep certain limited information about you
following the conclusion of your participation in the PGP, including your name, date of first
participation, date of enrollment and date of termination or withdrawal.
</p>

<p><strong><u>XII. ALTERNATIVES</u></strong></p>

<p>
       12.1 <u>Alternative.</u> The alternative is not to participate in the PGP.
</p>
<p>
       12.2 <u>No Effect.</u> If you choose not to participate, your medical treatment by your
doctor or other health care providers, or at your hospital, will not be affected.
</p>

<p><strong><u>XIII. DONATIONS</u></strong></p>

<p>
       13.1 <u>Opportunity for Financial Donation.</u>
</p>
<p>
       (a) <i>The Possible Donation.</i> You may be invited to make a financial donation to the
PGP (a “Donation”) in the event that you are invited to enroll in this study.
</p>
<p>
       (b) <i>No Obligation.</i> Participants will be enrolled whether or not a Donation is made
and without regard to the amount of any Donation. However, financial contributions are
encouraged and are important to the sustained success of the study. If you choose to make a
Donation it will be used to subsidize the cost of the PGP’s research and related activities.
